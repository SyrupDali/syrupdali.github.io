MentorApp is an application that can help you, as a mentee, to search for a mentor that can help you with the various tasks and challenges you face in your everyday life. On the other hand, if you are a mentor, you can spread your knowledge that you acquired from your student life and experience. 

To create an account, click the sign up button at the top right corner of the main page and fill in the information that is asked. IMPORTANT: the last questions are only if youâ€™re signing up as a mentor.

After that go back to the main page by clicking on our logo. IMPORTANT: you can always go back to the main page by selecting the logo, no matter what page you are on. Select correctly if you want to sign in as a mentee or a mentor.

If you have signed in as a mentee, the website will bring you to a page where you can enter a keyword to find a mentor that can help you with your task.

On the next page, choose the mentor that suits you the best based on skills and availability, and submit your request.

If you have signed in as a mentor, we will redirect you to a page where you can see the requests you have received, so make sure to select a preferred date and short description of whatever you want to share with your mentee.

Until now, these are all our functionalities, I hope that it was clear enough for you, and I hope that you understood everything.
